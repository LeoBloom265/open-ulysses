# Open Ulysses

**What if every word of *Ulysses* was a hyperlink?**  
Welcome to the wildest digital mosaic on the web.

Weâ€™re transforming all 265,222 words of James Joyceâ€™s *Ulysses* into clickable links â€” each pointing to a website, video, idea, project, meme, or story. Itâ€™s a collaborative portrait of the internet, one character at a time.
